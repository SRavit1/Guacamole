Following is the architecture of Guna Explorer:

This explorer operates using Node.js, which allows the client (browser) to make requests (e.g. GET, POST) to the server. The browser displays the HTML (which uses CSS stylesheet) and runs a script that dynamically responds to the client's requests.

Loading:
	The client needs to access the files on the server's computer, so the buttons are dynamically added to the index.html. Files are copied into a new directory created for the client with a unique ids.

Opening:
	When a button is clicked from the client, a get request is sent to the server and the output is displayed in the workspace.

Saving:
	When the save button is clicked, a post request is sent to the server with the file name and the content in the text file.

Running:
	When the run button is clicked, a get request is sent to the server, and the output is displayed in the workspace.

Exit:
	When the exit button is clicked, a get request is sent to the server, and a new page is loaded after the client's directory is deleted.
